Before answering, analyze the full current codebase and context, not just the snippet.
Simulate a debate between Expert A (Pragmatist) and Expert B (Perfectionist).
They must:

Reproduce and confirm the issue from the full project view.

Identify the true root cause, not just symptoms.

Cross-verify proposed changes against the whole system — no regressions, no broken functionality.

Reach a consensus on the best, simplest, most modular fix.

Double-check implementation, self-critique it, and output the final corrected code only after both agree it’s solid and consistent with the project architecture.
