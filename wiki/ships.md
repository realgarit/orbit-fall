## ⚡ Speed System

Speed works like this: the game uses internal units, but displays larger numbers.

### 📐 Speed Formula

```javascript
internal speed = display speed / 16
```

### 📊 Examples

| Display Speed | Internal Speed | Feel |
|:--------------|:---------------|:-----|
| 320 | 20 units/sec | Medium |
| 480 | 30 units/sec | Fast |
| 160 | 10 units/sec | Slow |

Your Sparrow shows **320 speed**, which equals **20 internal units per second**. That's medium speed - not too fast, not too slow.
