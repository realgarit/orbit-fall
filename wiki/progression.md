# 📈 Progression & Leveling

> **How you get stronger in Orbit Fall.** Experience, levels, and what unlocks when.

## ⭐ Experience System

You gain XP by killing enemies. Each enemy gives a fixed amount.

| Enemy | XP Reward |
|:------|:----------|
| 👾 **Drifter** | 400 XP per kill |

> 💡 **That's it for now.** More enemies = more XP sources later.

---

## 🧮 Level Formula

```
XP required = 10,000 × 2^(level - 2)
```

### 📊 Examples

| Level | XP Required | Calculation |
|:------|:------------|:------------|
| 1 | 0 XP | Starting level |
| 2 | 10,000 | 10,000 × 2^(2-2) = 10,000 |
| 3 | 20,000 | 10,000 × 2^(3-2) = 20,000 |
| 4 | 40,000 | 10,000 × 2^(4-2) = 40,000 |
| 5 | 80,000 | 10,000 × 2^(5-2) = 80,000 |
| 6 | 160,000 | 10,000 × 2^(6-2) = 160,000 |

> 📈 **It doubles each level.** Level 10 needs 2,560,000 XP. Level 20 needs 2,621,440,000 XP. It gets steep.

**Max Level**: 🏆 **44**
