# 💎 Ores & Resources

> **Ores are crystals you collect in space.** They're used for crafting and trading. Each ore takes up cargo space.

---

## 📦 Ore Basics

| Concept | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| 📦 **Cargo Space** | Each ore = 1 cargo unit |
| ✋ **Collection** | Fly close to an ore to collect it |
| 🗄️ **Storage** | Ores go into your cargo hold |
| 📊 **Capacity** | Your ship has a cargo limit (Sparrow = 100 units) |

---

## 💎 Ore Types

Ores come in two categories: **spawnable** (found on maps) and **crafted** (made from other ores).

---

## 🌍 Spawnable Ores

These appear naturally in space. Just fly around and collect them.

### 🔴 Scarlite

| Property | Value |
|:---------|:------|
| 🎨 **Color** | Reddish crystal |
| 📏 **Size** | Small |
| ⭐ **Rarity** | Common |
| 🌍 **Spawns** | Yes, on maps |

> 💡 **The most common ore.** You'll see these everywhere. Red crystals floating in space. Easy to find, easy to collect.

---

### 🔵 Azurite

| Property | Value |
|:---------|:------|
| 🎨 **Color** | Blueish crystal |
| 📏 **Size** | Small |

## 📊 Ore Collection Strategy

### ✅ Tips

1. 📦 **Fill your cargo**: Collect ores until you're full (100 units on Sparrow).

2. ⭐ **Prioritize rare ores**: Azurite is worth more than Scarlite. Grab the rare ones first.

3. 💾 **Save for crafting**: Don't sell everything. You'll need ores for crafting later.

4. 👀 **Watch your space**: Each ore = 1 cargo. Plan what you collect.

5. 🏠 **Return to base**: When full, go back to sell or craft. Then come back for more.

---

## 🔨 Crafting System

Right now, crafting happens through cargo boxes. You combine ores to make better ores.

### 📝 Example

```
Want Rosite?
→ Collect 20 Scarlite + 10 Azurite
→ Craft it in cargo boxes
```

> 💡 **Crafted ores are bigger** (take more visual space) but still only 1 cargo unit. They're worth more and used for higher-tier recipes.

---

## 💰 Ore Values

| Rarity | Value | Examples |
|:-------|:------|:----------|
| 🟢 **Common** | Lower value, easy to find | Scarlite |
| 🔵 **Rare** | Higher value, harder to find | Azurite |
| 🟡 **Very Rare** | Highest spawnable value, very hard to find | Aurite |
| ⭐ **Crafted** | Most valuable, but require materials | Rosite, Verdite, Aurumite |

> 💡 **The exact credit values aren't set yet.** But rare = more credits, that's the rule.

---

## 🔮 Future Uses

Ores will be used for:

- 💰 **Trading**: Sell them for credits
- 🔨 **Crafting**: Make better ores and items
- ⬆️ **Upgrades**: Use in equipment upgrades
- ✨ **Special items**: Required for unique gear

> 💡 **Right now, focus on collecting them.** The full economy is still being built.

---

## 💡 Tips

> ✅ **Don't ignore ores**: They're free money and crafting materials

> ⚖️ **Balance collection and combat**: Fight enemies for XP, collect ores for resources

> 💾 **Save rare ores**: Azurite and Aurite are harder to find. Keep them for crafting

> 👀 **Watch your cargo**: Full cargo means you can't collect more. Go sell/craft when full
