# ⚔️ Weapons

> **You have two weapon types:** Lasers are your main damage source. Rockets hit harder but fire slower.

## 🔫 Laser Cannons

Lasers fire continuously when you're in combat. They use laser ammunition, which multiplies the cannon's base damage.

### 📊 Available Laser Cannons

| Name | Base Damage | Cooldown | Description |
|:-----|:------------|:---------|:------------|
| 🔫 **PL-1** | 65 | 1.0s | Basic Pulse Laser - Entry-level laser cannon |
| 🔫 **BL-1** | 70 | 1.0s | Beam Laser - Slightly enhanced damage |
| 🔫 **PL-2** | 140 | 1.0s | Heavy Pulse Laser - Double the power |
| 🔫 **PL-3** | 175 | 1.0s | Elite Pulse Laser - Top-tier damage |

> 💡 **You start with the PL-1.** It's basic but works fine for early enemies.

### 🧮 How Laser Damage Works

```
Total Damage = (Cannon Base Damage) × (Ammo Multiplier)
```

#### 📈 Examples

| Setup | Calculation | Result |
|:------|:------------|:-------|
| PL-1 + LC-10 | 65 × 1 | **65 damage** |
| PL-1 + LC-25 | 65 × 2 | **130 damage** |
| PL-2 + LC-50 | 140 × 3 | **420 damage** |
| PL-3 + RS-75 | 175 × 6 | **1,050 damage** |

> ⚡ **All lasers fire once per second.** The difference is base damage and what ammo you use.

## 🔋 Laser Ammunition

Ammo multiplies your cannon's damage. Better ammo = more damage per shot.

### 📊 Available Laser Ammo

| Name | Multiplier | Description |
|:-----|:-----------|:------------|
| 🔋 **LC-10** | 1x | Basic Laser Cell - Standard ammunition |
| 🔋 **LC-25** | 2x | Medium Laser Cell - Enhanced damage |
| 🔋 **LC-50** | 3x | Advanced Laser Cell - High damage output |
| 🔋 **LC-100** | 4x | Ultra Laser Cell - Maximum standard damage |
| 🔋 **RS-75** | 6x | Rapid Strike Battery - Devastating burst damage |

> 💡 **You start with LC-10.** It's the weakest but it's free and works.

### 💥 Damage Examples

```
PL-1 + LC-10  = 65 damage
PL-1 + LC-25  = 130 damage
PL-1 + LC-50  = 195 damage
PL-3 + RS-75  = 1,050 damage
```

> 🚀 **Better cannons + better ammo = way more damage.**

|:-----|:-------|:------------|
| 💣 **RT-01** | 1,000 | Standard Rocket - Basic explosive damage |
| 💣 **RT-02** | 2,000 | Enhanced Rocket - Improved explosive damage |

## 🎯 Weapon Strategy

### ⚔️ Lasers
> **Your main damage source.** Auto-fire in combat, consistent damage, uses ammo.

### 💣 Rockets
> **Burst damage.** Manual fire, high damage, long cooldown. Good for finishing off enemies or starting fights.

### 💡 Best Combo
> **Use lasers for sustained damage, rockets for burst.** Save rockets for tough enemies or when you need quick kills.

---

## 📦 Ammunition Management

You need to keep ammo stocked. Lasers use laser cells, rockets use rocket ammo. Both are consumed when you fire.

| Ammo Type | Usage | Consumption Rate |
|:----------|:------|:----------------|
| 🔋 **Laser Ammo** | Every laser shot | Once per second in combat |
| 💣 **Rocket Ammo** | Manual rocket fire | When you press spacebar |

> ⚠️ **Running out of ammo means you can't fight.** Keep an eye on your ammo count.
