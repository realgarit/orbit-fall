## 👾 Available Enemies

### 👾 Drifter

> **Attitude**: 🟡 Defensive

#### 📊 Stats

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|:-----|:------|:------|
| ❤️ **Hitpoints** | 1,000 | Base health |
| 🛡️ **Shield** | 600 | Absorbs damage first |
| ⚡ **Base Speed** | 280 | Slower than you (320) |
| ⚔️ **Damage** | 20 per shot | Low damage |
| ⏱️ **Attack Cooldown** | 1.5 seconds | Between attacks |
| 📏 **Attack Range** | 30 units | Shorter than yours (40) |

#### 💰 Rewards

| Reward | Amount | Notes |
|:-------|:-------|:------|
| ⭐ **Experience** | 400 XP | Decent for early levels |
| 🏆 **Honor** | 2 | For special purchases |
| 💰 **Credits** | 400 | Enough for basic ammo |
| ✨ **Aetherium** | 1 | Premium currency |

**Description**: A basic alien vessel. Passive unless provoked.

> 💡 **This is the enemy you'll see most early on.** They're defensive, so they won't attack you first. But if you hit them, they'll fight back.

#### 💪 Total Health

```
600 (shield) + 1,000 (HP) = 1,600 total health
```

#### 🎯 Strategy

> **They're weak.** Your starting PL-1 + LC-10 does 65 damage per shot. That's about 25 shots to kill one (if you ignore shield). With rockets, it's faster.

> ⚡ **They move slower than you** (280 speed vs your 320), so you can outrun them if needed.

## ⚔️ Combat Behavior

When you attack a Drifter:

1. 🔄 It turns toward you
2. 🏃 It starts chasing you
3. ⚔️ It fires at you when in range (30 units)
4. 💥 It does 20 damage every 1.5 seconds

> 🤖 **They're not smart.** They just chase and shoot. Use that to your advantage.

## 💰 Rewards Breakdown

Killing a Drifter gives you:

| Reward | Amount | What It's For |
