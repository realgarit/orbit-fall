## 🎯 Your First Steps

### 1️⃣ Move Around
> **Click and hold** to fly. Your ship follows your mouse.

### 2️⃣ Find Enemies
> Look for NPC ships called **"Drifters"**. They're defensive - they won't attack unless you hit them first.

### 3️⃣ Start Combat
> **Double-click an enemy** to target it. Your lasers will auto-fire.

### 4️⃣ Collect Loot
> When enemies die, they drop credits and sometimes **bonus boxes**.

### 5️⃣ Mine Ores
> Look for **glowing crystals** floating in space. Fly close to collect them.

### 6️⃣ Level Up
> Keep fighting to gain experience. Each level needs more XP than the last.
